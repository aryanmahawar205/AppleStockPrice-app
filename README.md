# AppleStockPrice-app
Simple Web App deployed using Streamlit to display **Opening** and **Closing** stock prices of Apple from May 31st 2010 to May 31st 2020.

### Steps to run :

Apart from having Python3, you need to have streamlit up and running on your machine. This can be done by running the following command on your Terminal.

```bash
pip install streamlit
```

Next, you should have Yahoo Finance to fetch the actual stock price data. Run the following line on your Terminal.

```bash
pip install yfinance
```

To fire up and run the app, use this command in the directory where the actual application file is located.

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
